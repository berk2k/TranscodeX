# üé• Video Transcoding and Compression as a Service
## üöÄ Project Overview

This project delivers a **Video Transcoding and Compression as a Service** platform designed for video streaming companies.  
Our system efficiently processes raw video files uploaded by clients, transcoding them into multiple device-compatible formats and compressing them to optimize storage and streaming performance ‚Äî all handled seamlessly in the cloud.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components

The solution follows a **event driven microservices architecture** composed of four specialized services:

| Service           | Responsibility                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **upload-service** | Handles client video uploads and temporary file storage      |
| **process-service**| Manages transcoding and compression pipelines                 |
| **metadata-service** | Stores video metadata and tracks processing status           |
| **auth-service**   | Secures the system with authentication and authorization     |

Services communicate asynchronously via **RabbitMQ**, while video files are stored on **Backblaze B2**, ensuring scalability and reliability.
