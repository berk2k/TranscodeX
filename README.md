# üé• Video Transcoding and Compression As a Service

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project delivers a **Video Transcoding and Compression As a Service** platform designed for video streaming companies.  
Our system efficiently processes raw video files uploaded by clients, transcoding them into multiple device-compatible formats and compressing them to optimize storage and streaming performance ‚Äî all handled seamlessly in the cloud.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components

The solution follows a **event driven microservices architecture** composed of four specialized services:

| Service             | Responsibility                                               | Deployment                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **upload-service**   | Handles client video uploads and temporary file storage      | Azure Web Service for Containers   |
| **process-service**  | Manages transcoding and compression pipelines                 | Azure Web Service for Containers   |
| **metadata-service** | Stores video metadata and tracks processing status           | Azure Web Service for Containers   |
| **auth-service**     | Secures the system with authentication and authorization     | Azure Web Service for Containers  |

Services communicate asynchronously via **RabbitMQ**.

Video files are stored on **Backblaze B2**, ensuring scalable and cost-efficient cloud storage.

The **Traefik API Gateway** manages routing and middleware for all services and is deployed on **Render**.
